Seed Contains 2 → Winner Must Contain 5 or 4
Type: Manual
Logic: If digit 2 appears in the seed, then the winner must contain either digit 5 or digit 4.
Action: Eliminate if seed contains 2 and winner contains neither 5 nor 4.
1. Cold Digit Trap — Requires at least 1 digit from the 4 coldest digits.

5. Digit Spread < 4 — Eliminates combos with low spread between digits.
6. High-End Digit Limit — Eliminates if 2 or more digits ≥ 8.
7. All Low Digits (0–3) — Eliminates if all 5 digits are from 0 to 3.

10. Quint Filter — All 5 digits identical.
11. Quad Filter — 4 digits identical.
12. Triple Filter — 3 digits identical.
13. Mild Double-Double Filter — Exactly 4 digits: one twice, two once.
14. No 2-Digit Internal Mirror Pairs — Eliminates combos with digit and its mirror.
15. Prime Digit Filter — Eliminates combos with ≥2 prime digits (2,3,5,7).
16. Sum Category Transition Filter — Very Low to Mid.
17. Sum Category Transition Filter — Mid to Very Low.
18. Sum Category Transition Filter — Low to Mid.
19. Mirror Sum = Combo Sum — Eliminates combos whose digit sum matches seed mirror sum.
20. Combo Contains Last Digit of Mirror Sum — Manual filter.
21. Seed Contains 0 → Winner must contain 1, 2, or 3.
22. Seed Contains 1 → Winner must contain 2, 3, or 4.
23. Seed Contains 2 → Winner must contain 4 or 5.
24. V-Trac: All Digits Same Group — Eliminates if all digits share the same V-Trac group.
25. V-Trac: Only 2 Groups Present — Eliminates if only 2 V-Trac groups used.
26. V-Trac: All 5 Groups Present — Eliminates if all 5 V-Trac groups used.
27. V-Trac: All Seed V-Tracs Present — Eliminates if all V-Trac groups from seed are in combo.
28. V-Trac: None of Seed V-Tracs Present — Eliminates if no seed V-Tracs in combo.
29. Position 1 Cannot Be 4 or 7 — Manual trap filter.
30. Position 3 Cannot Be 3 or 9 — Manual trap filter.
31. Position 4 Cannot Be 4 — Manual trap filter.
32. Position 5 Cannot Be 4 — Manual trap filter.
